### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Multi-Language (i18n) ‚Äì Quick Guide
- All texts use `data-i18n` in HTML and are translated via JSON files in `assets/js/i18n/`.
- Language is toggled with a single button (flag icon), and direction (RTL/LTR) updates automatically.
- To add a language: copy an existing JSON, translate, and update the language switch logic if needed.
